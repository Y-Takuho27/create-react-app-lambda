## Create-React-App-Lambda

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-CRAL&utm_campaign=devex)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify/create-react-app-lambda&utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-CRAL&utm_campaign=devex)

> ⚠️NOTE: You may not need this project at all. [Netlify Dev](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-dev-plugin) works with `create-react-app` out of the box! Only use `netlify-lambda` if you need a build step for your functions, eg if you want to use Babel or TypeScript ([see its README for details](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/blob/master/README.md#netlify-lambda)).

## Project Setup

**Source**: The main addition to base Create-React-App is a new folder: `src/lambda`. This folder is specified and can be changed in the `package.json` script: `"build:lambda": "netlify-lambda build src/lambda"`.

**Dist**: Each JavaScript file in there will be built for Netlify Function deployment in `/built-lambda`, specified in [`netlify.toml`](https://www.netlify.com/docs/netlify-toml-reference/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-CRAL&utm_campaign=devex).

As an example, we've included a small `src/lambda/hello.js` function, which will be deployed to `/.netlify/functions/hello`. We've also included an async lambda example using async/await syntax in `async-dadjoke.js`.
